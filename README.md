#Exploring Diddle Soup

Five years ago, when I started being interested in Irish Folk music I thought it sounded to me like Diddle Soup.
When I went all bright eye to the sessions and sat not really playing my flute because I could barely make noise on it, I would hear musicians discuss how they thought that this, or that other tune (its only called a song if someone is singing, if its just instruments its called a tune) was very interesting. I would sit there and silently think to myself: "I have no idea what they were talking about!", because frankly, to me they all sounded the same.
But, I was hooked to the idea of playing the flute. So I kept practicing and I kept going back to sessions. And I realized that I would walk away with three or four notes stuck in my head. They would cycle over and over just like a line of a popsong does when I listen to the radio. In German that's called an "Ohrwurm" literally: Earworm. The earworms would get longer. I remember the day that a whole A part (most likely 8 bars of music) was stuck in my head while I was trying to sleep. It felt like a major milestone in my musical development.
All this is to explain the motivation for my project. I wanted to see if a Machine Learning Algorythm, just like my brain, could start learning the patterns of Irish Folk Music.

I chose Irish Folk Music for two reasons. One is that I have domain knowledge as I play it, the other being that I decided the simple structure might be both interesting or provide difficulty for the algorythm.

As I am also a linguist and think about the world predominantly in terms of language, I wanted to use a data driven approach to finding the patterns that my brain were supplying me with.

I used a character based Ngram Model.

I'm interested in finding the vocabulary of Irish Folk music.
